Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A branch is a seperate piece of code on your local computer, that branches off of a master, and is still part of the repository. A clone is when you directly copy from another repository, but there is no link. A fork is a copy of another repository, but there is a link to the first repository. You cannot change the first repository.
